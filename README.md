A Comparison between NDR-Learner and Causal Forest

This GitHub Repository is meant to be a companion for the Master Thesis "A Comparison between NDR- Learner and Causal Forest" by Marvin Scherer (2022). The code for the 6 different simulations and their respective plots can be found in the folder `Code`. The code and the plots are run in R and are mainly built with help of the `causalDML`, `grf`, `causalToolbox` and `tidyverse` package. Please refer to the paper for more detailed information or to the documentation of the respective packages in case of more specific questions.

If you clone this repository, make sure to:

- Create a `Results` and `Figures` folder inside of your `Code` folder for the simulations and plots to run smoothly and store the results and the plots.
- Input your working directory in `"YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY"` at the beginning of each R Script (line 14 for simulations and line 9 for `plots.R`) (See image below).

- Take into account that the simulations can take a long run time and be computationally expensive (up to 24h+).
